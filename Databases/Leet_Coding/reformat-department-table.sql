/*

MAX function and group by id is used to avoid multiple entries of id + revenue combinations like 

+----+-------------+-------------+
| id | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue |
+----+-------------+-------------+
|  1 |        NULL |        7000 |
|  1 |        8000 |        NULL |
|  1 |        NULL |        NULL |
|  2 |        9000 |        NULL |
|  3 |        NULL |       10000 |
